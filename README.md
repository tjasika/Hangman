# Hangman 🪢

A classic **Hangman** game in React.js - with my own illustrations!

### Components and pages
I separated the project into three pages: 
- The landing page (*StartPage.jsx*)
- The main page (*GamePage.jsx*)
- The end page (*EndPage.jsx*)
I did not need many components, since I handled most of everything inside GamePage.jsx. But I did create the following:
- *Letter-jsx*: for the letter buttons
- *ImageContainer.jsx*: for the main hangman images display
#### Data
I stored all the words inside a *words.json* file, which is just an array of strings.


### Game Logic
The main logic is in the **GamePage.jsx** page. 

### Styling
